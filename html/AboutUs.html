        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>Web design is an activity that consists of planning, design, implementation
           and maintenance of websites. It is not simply the implementation of conventional design 
           since it covers different aspects such as web graphic design, interface design and user 
           experience, such as navigability, interactivity, usability, information 
           architecture; media interaction, among which we can mention audio, text, image, links, video and search 
           engine optimization. Many people often work in teams that cover different aspects of the design 
           process, although there are some independent designers who work alone.</p>

        <h3>programming languages</h3>
        <p>A programming language is a formal language that provides a series of instructions that allow a programmer 
           to write sequences of commands and algorithms in order to control the physical and logical behavior of a computer
           in order to produce various kinds of data. All this set of orders and data written by means of a programming language 
           is known as a program.</p>

        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>An API is an application programming interface (English API: application programming interface). It is a set of routines 
            that provides access to functions of a specific software. They are published by software builders to allow access to low-level 
            or proprietary features, detailing only how each routine should be carried out and the functionality it provides, without providing 
            information about how the task is carried out. They are used by programmers to build their applications without re-programming functions 
            already made by others, reusing code that is known to be tested and working properly.</p>
